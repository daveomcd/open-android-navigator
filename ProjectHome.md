<strong>Project History:<br />
</strong>This project was started by four students from the University of Southern Mississippi as a senior project.  Most of the group had no previous experience with Java or any Android development.  During development the group decided to create this project page to help others interested in the development community.

**Due to deadlines we have posted source code perhaps prematurely hopefully we will have it properly formatted and better organized soon.  However, please keep this in mind. Thanks!**
